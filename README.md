# Advent of Code 2024
Haskell solutions to the 2024 Advent of Code problem set created by Eric Wastl.

The problems can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2024

`src/` contains the complete source code for my solutions.
`annotations/` contains write-ups explaining my solutions.
N.B. `Common.Runner` has not been included in this repo because it has sensitive data. However, its main purpose is to interface with `advent-of-code-api` via `runSolutionOnInput`. It is only responsible for downloading the inputs and caching them and nothing else.
